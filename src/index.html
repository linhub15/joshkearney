        <h3 class="font-bold text-center">About me</h3>

        <p>
          My name is Josh Kearney and I am an educator based out of Edmonton, Alberta. I'm originally from Whitehorse,
          Yukon but moved down to Edmonton in 2019 to pursue my university education. Having just graduated in Spring
          2025, I am now looking for ways to spread my love of education with my community - whether that be physical,
          academic, or artistic education. As a Breakdancer, a School Teacher, and an Athlete, I am passionate about how
          all the different types of education can intersect and influence success in each other.
        </p>

        <p>
          When it comes to tutoring, my philosophy is based heavily on the idea that every person is intelligent and a
          body of knowledge. Often times, students are made to feel like they don't know anything, but that is rarely
          the case. As their tutor, my job to connect my students prior knowledge to the academic world in order to
          improve their abilities as students.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-bold text-center">Fun Facts</h3>

        <p>I am a Community Leader in Edmonton's Breakdancing Non-Profit - Freestyle Movement - where I plan events and
          help support our greater Breakdancing community. I also, love nature and going on adventures so if you have
          any advice for where to explore here in Alberta, I would love to hear it!</p>
